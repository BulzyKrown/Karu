## What is a variable? [ðŸ”º](#commands)
When we talk about variables, it means that we have more than one parameter with which Karu can identify the command. In this section I'm going to show you which variables you can use with Karu in some commands.

Some commands also mention more than one variable divided by a */*, meaning that you can occupy only one of the options. Another case is that of the NSFW commands, I will give you an example with the one of `//hentai`, it has a sub-command that calls a list, `//hentai list`, if you use some of those parameters it would be for example...  `//hentai classic` and **no** `//hentai list classic`.

### @user

This parameter means that Karu can search for the person, user or member that you want by means of a mention, it is of the forms that but it occupies to Karu.

### ID

This parameter means that Karu can also search for the person, user or member you want by means of their ID, it is an optional form to not mention that person.
